This was my first ML project. I followed a video series on Youtube created by SentDex to create the initial program architecture, but plan to make a few tweaks of my own so that it performs basic object recognition on the MNIST data set.

Eventually, I'd like to update it further so that it can perform edge detection and see if it can be used by an agent with a camera to navigate a maze.
